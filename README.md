# PokerSolver

Welcome to my Poker Solver App!

Currently supports 
1. Calculating Pot Odds given a) total amount in pot b) amount you need to call
2. Calculate the percentage of hitting your outs either on the flop or turn given a) number of outs
3. Calculate the Expected Value of a decision given a) equity percentage b) amount you need to call c) total amount in pot

*Not built with a build tool so to run program, you must compile all necessary classes and run off the command line. Sorry! Will fix in future.
